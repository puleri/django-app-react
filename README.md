## Summary

The frontend was created with JavaScript/HTML/CSS and the React framework.

### My Development Process

1. Lay out estimated schedule.
1. Begin by reviewing documentation and react front-ends for reference.
1. Build Project component.
1. Create/Test axios calls for project CRUD.
1. Debug by conferring with peers.
1. Deploy


## Commands

Commands are run with the syntax `python3 manage.py <command>`:

| command | action |
|---------|--------|
| `npm start`  |  Run the server |
| `npm run deploy`  | Deploy to the web  |
| update text editor if server is displaying old commit  | Debug  |

## Future iterations

In future iterations of the app I would like to utilise bootstrap in project forms,
allow for more interaction and more information to be displayed on the index of
projects.
